This project request to choose an area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OSM data for that place.
 
I have chosen Toulouse (France) that is the city I live since 2003. This is a city very interesting from several point of view:
1.	this is a university town that means there are a lot of student and young people living there and not only French people, 
2.	it is the city where Airbus has his headquarter then there are a lot of aircraft and activities around design and manufacturing aircraft,
3.	it is very close to the mountains (Pirinees) were you can go for walking or skiing
4.	it is the middle of the way from Atlantic Ocean to Mediterranean sea, that means you can go easily to one of those areas to enjoy the sea and the beach  
5.	the city itself is big enough to have a very rich cultural life but not too much big to overwhelmed you 
6.	there climate is good, you have rain and sun in winter and summer

I wanted to investigate if the if OSM was at the level of quality that a city like Toulouse deserve
